Customizing schematik
=====================

One of the important design principles of schematik was to ensure maximum customizabilty and extensibility. So we have a large number of options for influencing the generated schematics, you have access to generated schematic data and can implement a custom renderer over it. You can integrate it with existing native application and much more.

We have compiled a list of examples/tutorials to explain how certain elements can be customized:
